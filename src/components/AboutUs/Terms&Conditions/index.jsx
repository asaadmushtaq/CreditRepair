The credit bureaus must remove accurate, negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old. Bankruptcy information can be reported up to 10 years. You have the right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau. You may be charged a reasonable fee. There is no fee, however if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance or rental dwelling because of information in your credit report within the preceding 60 days. The credit bureau must provide someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file. You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days or if you are a recipient of public welfare assistance or if you have reason to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report due to fraud. You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act. This law prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organizations. Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to insure that the information they report is accurate. However, mistakes may occur. You may on your own, notify a credit bureau in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file. The credit bureau must then investigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information. The credit bureau may not charge any fee for this service. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be given to the credit bureau. If the credit bureau’s reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the credit bureau, to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate. The credit bureau must include a summary of your statement about disputed information with any report it issues to you.
